You are an expert front-end engineer and GIS mapping developer. I want you to build a very simple, lightweight Digital Twin web application for one city (Nashik) using only basic web technologies like React (or HTML-CSS-JS if simpler). Do NOT use heavy frameworks like Reflex, Django, Node backends, etc. Keep everything front-end only.

Your primary requirement:
→ Completely follow and recreate the same layout, UI, components, colors, card styles, navigation, graphs, and map design shown in my files (dashboard, map, alerts, analytics).  
→ Do NOT change the design. Only rebuild it in simple web code.

The Digital Twin app must include these modules, but all with dummy data only:

1. **3D Map Page (Live Map View)**  
   - Use Mapbox GL JS (or any simple library) for a Nashik map.  
   - Add simple 3D buildings or a dummy 3D campus placeholder.  
   - Add multiple map views:  
       • Street  
       • Satellite  
       • Environmental (AQI layer)  
       • Crowd Heatmap Layer  
       • CO₂ Color Zone Layer  
   - Add buttons/tabs to switch between views (matching my design).  
   - Add marker icons for “pollution hotspots”, “crowd zones”, “traffic”, etc., using dummy data.

2. **Dashboard Page**  
   - Recreate the same dashboard layout I have:  
       • AQI card  
       • CO₂ card  
       • Traffic card  
       • Flood/Weather card  
       • Summary section  
   - Use the same card design from my PPT.  
   - Use dummy numbers that refresh every few seconds using JavaScript timers.

3. **Alerts Page**  
   - Recreate my alerts UI design (vertical alert cards).  
   - Alerts must include:  
       • Air quality alert  
       • Weather alert  
       • CO₂ high alert  
       • Traffic congestion alert  
       • Crowd density alert  
   - Use dummy alert generation logic (e.g., every 10 seconds create one fake alert).

4. **Analytics Page**  
   - Recreate the same analytics design (charts section).  
   - Use Chart.js or similar to show:  
       • AQI today vs last month vs last year  
       • CO₂ timeline  
       • Temperature trends  
       • Rainfall comparison  
   - All data should be dummy static arrays.

5. **Sensors/Modules Folder**  
   - Create simple JS modules like:  
       • air_quality.js  
       • weather.js  
       • traffic.js  
       • camera.js  
       • water.js  
   - Each module must export:  
       • getDummyData() function  
       • randomizer to simulate live data  
       • alertRules() function that decides when an alert is triggered.  

6. **Navigation**  
   - Exactly same navbar look as in my PPT and app design.  
   - Tabs:  
       • Home  
       • Live Map  
       • Alerts  
       • Analytics  
       • Sensors  
       • About  

7. **Preserve my design**  
   - Colors, style, gradients, card shadows, borders must match my original layout.  
   - UI must look visually identical to the PPT/screenshots.  
   - Use clean modern CSS (no frameworks needed unless you prefer Tailwind).

8. **Output Requirements**  
   - Provide full folder structure.  
   - Provide complete working code for every file.  
   - Provide CSS for matching the exact design.  
   - Provide dummy GeoJSON for CO₂ zones, heatmap, and hotspots.  
   - Provide instructions on how to run the app with:  
       npm install  
       npm run dev  
   - Explain how to replace dummy data with real APIs later.

9. **Keep the code extremely simple.**  
   - No backend.  
   - No complex state management.  
   - Just simple React components or pure JS modules.

10. **Deliverables at the end:**  
   - Complete project code  
   - Map, alerts, dashboard, analytics pages  
   - Dummy sensor modules  
   - Dummy GeoJSON  
   - Instructions to run  
   - Notes for future upgrade

Build everything strictly following these instructions and matching my design.
